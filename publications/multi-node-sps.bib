abstract = {Spot instances let users access unused cloud resources at significantly reduced costs. While cloud vendors offer availability information, existing tools like Spotlake only provide single-node availability data, which falls short for modern distributed applications. This paper highlighted the limitations of single-node availability data and introduced a multi-node availability dataset collection system. We analyzed the collected data and enhanced Spotlake to share these multi-node datasets publicly for broader use.},
